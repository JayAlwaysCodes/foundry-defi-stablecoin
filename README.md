We will building a Stable Coin for this project that is based off:
    1. Relative Stability: Anchored or Pegged -> $1.00
       1. Chainlink Price Feed
       2. Set a functionn to exchange ETH & BTC -> $$$
    2. Stability Mechanism (Minting): Algorithmic (Decentralized)
       1. People can only mint the stablecoin with enough collateral (coded)
    3. Collateral: Exogenous(crypto)
        1. wETH
        2. wBTC
